# TunerX 

"Software is like sex: it's better when it's free."  — Linus Torvalds.

This project is made for anyone who doesn't want to pay for radios station - it was insipred by vTuner and i was intrested in the idea so i rewrote it from scratch.

In addition , i would encourage anyone to try and change what i did in the src , im aware its not perfect and I'd love suggestions!
